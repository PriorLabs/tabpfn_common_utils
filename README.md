# tabpfn-common-utils

## Installation
Install uv if not done already.

```bash
uv sync
```
installs all dependencies into a virtual environment.

Activate the venv
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
This is optional and each command could be prefixed with `uv run` instead.

If you use [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/), entering this directory will setup everything for you.
